    company: "htc",
    info:
      "The HTC 10 is a beautifully crafted smartphone with a gorgeous display and an ergonomic design. This phone is the first to have optical image stabilisation for the front facing camera, which does help when shooting in low light. The phone has very snappy performance thanks to the Snapdragon 820 SoC, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. The USB Type-C port gets USB 3.1 Gen 1 speeds for faster data transfers. Sense UI is now leaner than ever, with many of the custom apps traded in favour of Google's native apps. Camera performance is good thanks to the 12 Ultrapixel 2 sensor, OIS and laser autofocus. The built-in battery lasts an entire day but doesn't do too well if you watch a lot of videos. Overall, the HTC 10 is a solid flagship that can go toe-to-toe with the best in the business.",
